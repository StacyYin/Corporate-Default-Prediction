# Corporate-Default-Prediction
This is a data analysis competition involving 20,000+ enterprises.

It includes original datasets which were divided into train part and test part.

Submission is the final result to implement the models, which I automatically got from the new data portal.

Model blender is the way I wrapped up some models for trying to achieve a better accuracy value.
